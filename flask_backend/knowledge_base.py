    ("hello","hi"):"Hello I am Quick Bot here to help you for first aid Emergency and Drugs details i can explain",
    ("heart attack", "cardiac arrest", "chest pain"): "Use SOS button to inform emergency services immediately. Help the person sit down, loosen tight clothing, and offer aspirin if not allergic. Perform CPR if they become unresponsive.",
    ("stroke", "brain attack", "paralysis"): "Call emergency services immediately and stay calm. Ensure the person is safe, lying on their side with their head slightly raised. Check their breathing and perform CPR if needed. Apply pressure to any wounds if they are bleeding. Observe their condition, note symptom details, and communicate calmly while waiting for help. Avoid giving them anything to eat or drink.",
    ("asthma attack", "difficulty breathing", "wheezing"): "Help them sit upright to ease their breathing, and stay calm to reassure them. Assist them in using their rescue inhaler, usually one puff every 30-60 seconds, up to 10 puffs. Keep them away from any potential triggers like smoke or allergens. If symptoms don't improve or they don't have an inhaler, call emergency services immediately. Monitor their condition and be ready to act until professional help arrives. Prompt action is crucial in managing asthma attacks.",
    ("seizures", "epileptic fit", "convulsions"): "Focus on keeping them safe until the seizure passes. Clear the area around them to prevent injury, and place something soft under their head if possible. Roll them onto their side to help keep their airway clear, and loosen tight clothing around their neck. Never hold them down or put anything in their mouth. Stay with them and time the seizure. If the seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes, or if it's their first seizure, use SOS button to inform emergency services immediately.",

Remove any clothing or jewelry near the burn unless it's stuck to the skin. Cover the burn with a clean, non-stick bandage or cloth, and avoid applying ice, butter, or ointments as they can worsen the injury. For severe burns or burns in sensitive areas, seek medical help immediately. Acting quickly can greatly reduce harm.",

Repeat until the object is dislodged.",
    ("drowning", "water inhalation", "submersion"): "Act quickly but stay calm. First, ensure your own safety before attempting a rescue. If possible, use a floatation device or something to extend your reach, like a stick or rope, to pull them to safety. Once they're out of the water, check if they're breathing. If they're not, begin CPR immediately if you're trained, focusing on chest compressions and rescue breaths. Call emergency services as soon as possible. Keep them warm and monitor their condition until help arrives.",
    ("snakebite", "venomous bite", "cobra bite"): "Keep them calm and still to slow the spread of venom. Immobilize the affected area and keep it at or below heart level.

Speak in a soft, soothing tone and let them know you're there for them. Encourage slow, deep breaths by demonstrating it yourself—inhale deeply through your nose, hold for a moment, and exhale slowly through your mouth.",
    ("cpr", "how to do cpr"): "Check responsiveness: Tap the person and shout to see if they respond. Call emergency services if unresponsive. Start chest compressions: Place your hands in the center of their chest, push hard and fast. Rescue breaths (if trained): After 30 compressions, tilt their head back, lift their chin, pinch their nose, and give 2 breaths into their mouth. Repeat: Alternate 30 compressions with 2 breaths until help arrives or they recover. Focus on compressions only if untrained: Skip breaths and continue compressions.",
